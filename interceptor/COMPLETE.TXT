  It does NOT contain the original LDraw program or most
  of the parts included in the original distribution archives.
  This file only contains new parts and some original parts
  that have been modified or fixed.
  The original LDraw archive (ldraw.exe - approx. 1mb), and
  the two original updates (lp97-13.exe/lp97-14.exe) *must*
  be installed prior to installing the complete.exe parts update.

 ----------------=< A T T E N T I O N >=-----------------

1) -NEW parts.lst file generator!!!

   This archive also contains a revised parts.lst generator
   program named MKLST.EXE.  It _should_ work on any computer.
   This replaces the original MAKELIST.EXE _and the follow-on
   programs MAKELST2.EXE and MAKELST3.EXE.
   The original will no longer work, and the 2 & 3 versions had
   problems not working on some DOS and WinNT machines.

   If MKLIST.EXE fails to work on your computer, you _must_ download
   a current parts.lst file from:
   http://hugin.risoe.dk/JJ_Memorial/partslst.html
   AND, please let us know!  We can't fix it if we don't know
   it is broke!


2) -ATTENTION!!

   Generally, when a part number is changed, a matching
   "~Moved to" file is created to make the change painless to you, the
   user.  But occasionally, that is not possible. Below are some
   parts that have had their numbers changed, and that require you to 
   manually update you model files, if necessary.

  ("NEW" users may skip the rest of this section - but read section 3)

 *** You only need to do this if you have _USED_ one of the       *** 
 *** following files in a model.  If you have never used any      ***
 *** of these, you can ignore this message, and skip this section ***
  -------------------------------------------------
 References in _your_ model files to:

  -6238.dat Must be changed to 600.dat 
        This is the Freestyle Door  1 x  6 x  6

  -3137.dat Must be changed to 3137c01.dat
        This is the Brick  2 x  2 with Wheels

  -3149.dat Must be changed to 3149c01.dat
        This is the Hinge Plate  2 x  5

  -3324.dat Must be changed to 3324c01.dat
        This is the Hinge Plate  2 x  9

  -3939.dat Must be changed to 3942.dat
        This is the Cone  2 x  2 x  2

  -3942.dat Must be changed to 3943.dat
        This is the Cone  4 x  4 x  2

  -4319.dat is the Hinge Rod with Split Rod Holder 8L piece
   2375.dat is the Hinge Rod with Split Rod Holder 12L piece
   I mistakenly released these pieces with the numbers
   transposed. So, if you have ever used one of these pieces,
   you may want to doublecheck and make sure the right
   piece is in your model.

  -2562.dat Must be changed to 2536.dat
        The old 2562/current 2536 is the Plant Tree Palm 
        Trunk.  In update 2000-02, the Minifig Gun Flintlock 
        Pistol was released as 2562.

3) -An informational note about "~Moved to" files:

 You may notice that when you render models in LDraw, that
 text messages show up in the upper left corner of the screen,
 or in LDlite, show up briefly in the info bar along the bottom.
 
 These are telling you that you are using parts that have been
 moved, and that ldraw is jumping to the new part number.
 Ideally you should not have any of those messages in your models.
 You can prevent those from being in your model by not using
 any parts that have a description line starting with "~Moved to".

 You can fix older models by manually correcting the old numbers
 or, if you have Win95 and LDrawAddon (LDAO), you can use LDAO's
 'Update Moved Parts' function in the 'Tools' menu to update most
 moved parts in your own model files.
 Each model file must be processed individually, and you should
 BACK-UP the file before updating it. 
 I have had no problems using this feature of LDAO, but it is
 always better to be safe than sorry.
 Hopefully, we will get a DOS program written to do the same
 function for those without Win95.
